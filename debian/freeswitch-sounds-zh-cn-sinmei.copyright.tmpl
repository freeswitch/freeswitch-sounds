 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE

 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND

 1. Definitions
 .
   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
   other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
   derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
   literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
   cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
   recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
   derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
   Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
   this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
   work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
   timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
   Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
   as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
   broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
   in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
   arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
   which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
   with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
   independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
   collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
   considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
   License.

   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
   copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or

   Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher;

   musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
   play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
   expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
   being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
   performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
   organization that transmits the broadcast.
 .
   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
   terms of this License including without limitation any production in
   the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode

   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
   respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
   Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
   violation.
 .
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
   and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
   means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
   digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
   way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
   at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
   public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
   the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
   to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
   sounds or images.
 .
   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including

 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
   Collections;
 .
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
   steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
   were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
   marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
   a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
   incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
     in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
     compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
     the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
     You of the rights granted under this License;
 .
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
     which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
     compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
     the rights granted under this License; and,
 .
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
     collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
     Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
     voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
     You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
   terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
   any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
   ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
   that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
   the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
   and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
   Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
   measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
   Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
   the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
   incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
   apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
   License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
   must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
   as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
   Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
   practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
   Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
   or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
   Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
   name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
   and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
   or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
   attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
   terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
   or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
   extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
   specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
   and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
   a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
   "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
   based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
   this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
   provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
   a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
   authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
   credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
   other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
   use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
   in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
   License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
   connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
   Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
   use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
   permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
   Parties.
 .
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
   Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
   take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
   prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
   agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
   of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
   make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
   modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
   Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
   as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
   applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
   right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
   but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
   Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
   licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
   full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
   will survive any termination of this License.
 .
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
   is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
   Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
   the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
   not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
   been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
   and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
   terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
   on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License.
 .
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
   Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
   same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
   License.
 .
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
   by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
   the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
   enforceable.
 .
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
   and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
   with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
   agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
   here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
   may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
   modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
   this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
   Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
   amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
   Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
   of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
   1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
   jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
   according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
   those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
   standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
   includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
   additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
   License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
   applicable law.

 .
      3.1. Application of License.
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
      Section 3.5.
 .
      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
      3.3. Description of Modifications.
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
           (a) Third Party Claims.
           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
           (b) Contributor APIs.
           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
                (c)    Representations.
           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
           this License.
 .
      3.5. Required Notices.
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
      terms You offer.
 .
      3.7. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
      understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
      6.1. New Versions.
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
      will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.
 .
      6.3. Derivative Works.
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
      this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
      shall survive.
 .
      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
      the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
      Participant.
 .
      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
      license.
 .
      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
      prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
      rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
      License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
      3.3. Description of Modifications.
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
           (a) Third Party Claims.
           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
           (b) Contributor APIs.
           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
                (c)    Representations.
           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
           this License.
 .
      3.5. Required Notices.
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
      terms You offer.
 .
      3.7. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
      understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
      6.1. New Versions.
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
      will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.
 .
      6.3. Derivative Works.
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
      this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
      shall survive.
 .
      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
      the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
      Participant.
 .
      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
      license.
 .
      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
      prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
      rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
      License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
